## Tasks
Create a Using :nth-child() Page. 

## Using :nth-child() Page Description
This page demonstrates the use of the :nth-child() pseudo-class in CSS. It includes a table with selectors and elements where various CSS rules can be applied using :nth-child().

The header contains a title and a control panel with a reset button and three radio buttons to select the type of content displayed (digits, hippo, and fish).

The main section includes a table with rows demonstrating different :nth-child selectors (such as :first-child, :last-child, :nth-child(even), etc.). Each row begins with a pseudo-button that allows you to apply the selector to that row.

JavaScript adds interactivity to the page: it changes the row content between numbers and animal icons, resets the page to its original state, and displays tooltips for selected row elements based on the chosen selector etc.
